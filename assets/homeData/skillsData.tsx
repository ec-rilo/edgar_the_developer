  `
  I started programming years ago when I jumped into college with C++ where I
  learned the fundamentals of programming. From there I was hooked. After work, I'd spend
  my free time coding straight into the night going through a program called The Odin Project
  where I learned the basics of HTML & CSS up to React and Firebase.
  `,
  `
  I wanted to push my skills to the next level and through grit and determination was able to
  graduate from Hack Reactor, an Advanced Software Engineering Immersive that pushed me to my limits.
  I came out of the program refining the skills I knew and gained new ones.
  `,
  `
  These skills are only a few of many I know! And it definitely won't stop here.
